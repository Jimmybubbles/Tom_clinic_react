          A medical fee is the amount charged by a medical practitioner for a medical service. 
          The cost of medical services can vary depending on the type of service, the location, and the medical practitioner. 
          In Australia, the Medical Benefits Schedule (MBS) lists all the medical services that are eligible for a Medicare benefit. 
          The MBS also lists the fee that Medicare pays for each service. The difference between the fee charged by the medical practitioner and the fee paid by 
          Medicare is known as the out-of-pocket cost or gap payment
